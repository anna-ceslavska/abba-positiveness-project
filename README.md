| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `abba_analysis.Rmd` | The original R Markdown file used to generate the report |
| `abba.html`         | The compiled report |
| `abba_data.csv`     | Spotify dataset used in the analysis |

## Objective
To evaluate whether there is a statistical relationship between how positive a song sounds and how popular it is on Spotify.

## Tools Used
- **R**, with tidyverse (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`)
- **Linear Regression** (`lm`)
- **R Markdown** to generate this report

## Key Steps
- Cleaned and explored the dataset of ABBA‚Äôs songs from Spotify
- Visualized the distribution of positiveness and popularity
- Ran a linear regression: `Popularity ~ Positiveness`
- Interpreted model significance and R¬≤ value
- Summarized insights in a reproducible HTML report

## Results
While positiveness is *statistically significant*, the model shows a very weak relationship (R¬≤ ‚âà 0.007), suggesting that positiveness alone does not strongly predict popularity among ABBA's songs.
